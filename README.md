# APS360_Satellite_Image_Categorization
This project is completed for APS360 by Aiqi Zhang, Kara Ning, Emma Wang and Yijie Wang. 

The advancement of satellite imagery has opened new horizons in understanding and interpreting the Earth's surface, offering insights into the complex dynamics of landscapes across the globe. Automatic categorization and segmentation of land covers has become crucial across various fields, such as urban planning, agriculture, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. With the exponential growth of remote sensing data, there is also a growing need for efficient and accurate image segmentation techniques, which motivated this project.
