# APS360_Satellite_Image_Categorization

Satellite image segmentation is the process of characterizing the different types of landscape in an image. It allows the extraction of important information for applications such as monitoring environmental status and urban planning. In this project, team built and trained a neural network to facilitate this process, taking an input image and outputting the percentage of each landscape type. 

Code and other relevant documents will be uploaded as the team makes progress on this project.
